      <h3>Open the console to see the output from this code</h3>
	<p>There are two exercises in this practice set</p>
	<ol>
    		<li>In the first, you must write the logMessage() function that will make the call on line 6 write the argument to the console. </li>
    		<li>In the second, you will add input validation to this function so that the test cases work. If you've done it correctly, test cases 1-3 should output a truncated string (or the original, if the "targetLength" value isn't greater than the string length) , while test cases 4 and 5 will output the string "Invalid Input".</li>
	</ol>
